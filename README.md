# Portfolio – Influenza Staff Allocation

## Project Overview

- Goal: To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

- Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

- Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
  
- Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

### Assumptions:
- Vulnerable populations suffer the most-severe impacts from the flu and are the most likely to end up in the hospital.
- Flu shots decrease the chance of becoming infected with the flu.

### Constraints:
- The staffing agency has a limited number of nurses, physician assistants, and doctors on staff.
- There’s no money to hire additional medical personnel.

## Datasets

Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender was originally compiled by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). I used an edited version produced by Amazon AWS, which can be found [here](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da_program/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx).

Population data by geography was originally compiled by the US Census Bureau. I used an edited version produced by Amazon AWS, which can be found [here](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv).

Additional datasets originally compiled by the CDC were edited and provided by CareerFoundry for the project. However, the additional datasets were not useful to the completion of the project and were not used.
